<h1>Understand who I am as a person</h1>
<p>My path as a Front-End developer has led me to a focus in Ruby on Rails and Squarespace development. During the warmer months, I enjoy traveling to some great downhill mountain biking locations or finding a remote lake somewhere new for kayaking. Although the majority of the year, you will find me behind a computer screen. I am a passionate gamer which has had a huge impact on the start of my career, but that's a story for another time. <br><br>Throughout the years I've worked for places that feel the need to constantly burnout their employees with horrible requests and ridiculous timelines. Having been put through some bad experiences in my past, I've also had some great ones that allowed me to work with some amazing people who have played key roles in my career. I have worked very hard to get where I am today, but I'm just as passionate about where my career is leading me. The challenges that I deal with on a day-to-day basis I find meaningful and rewarding. Bottom line: I honestly love what I do and I will do whatever it takes to further my career. </p>
